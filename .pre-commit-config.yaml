# Pre-commit configuration file,
# when Streamlit's pre-commit detects that one of the linters has failed,
# it automatically lints the files and does not allow the commit to pass. 
# Please review the changes after lint has failed and commit them again,
# the second commit should pass,
# because the files were linted after trying to do the first commit.
