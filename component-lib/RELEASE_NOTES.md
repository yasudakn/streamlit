# Release notes

# 2.0.0

This release has no significant changes to our API, but we bump the major version as
the [`apache-arrow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-arrow) library is updated, which may affect users of the library. For details, see: [Apache Arrow Releases](https://arrow.apache.org/release/).

Moreover, it is worth adding that:
* The new version of `apache-arrow` requires a newer version of Typescript to work, but thanks to that you can also use `create-react-script` 5 and newer and the latest versions of NodeJS.
* We dropped use of [`event-target-shim`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/event-target-shim) as modern browsers no longer need it.
