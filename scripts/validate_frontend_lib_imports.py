"""
Iterate all Typescript files in the frontend/lib directory and ensure they don't import from
'src/app'. Exit with a non-zero error code if any file has an illegal import.

We're doing this ahead of splitting the frontend into two distinct packages (app and lib).
Once the split is complete, this script will be unnecessary and can be removed!
